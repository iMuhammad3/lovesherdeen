        Okay first journaling of the year comes 20 days after the year starts.
        So what are my recent thoughts, what do i want to write down. Well today
        I was watching a video on youtube and someone asked Hikaru what it takes
        to become one in a billion. I sat there and thought, “wait, Hikaru is
        actually a one in a billion person”. Of course only in a chess aspect.
        He’s better than billions at chess so that does make him one in a
        billion. Hikaru’s reply to the question was that he quoted Malcom
        Gladwell saying it takes ten thousand hours to truly master anything. At
        that point I paused the video and started having different thoughts like
        realising that if I truly want to be good at something, all i have to do
        is put in many hours into learning and practice, more hours than anybody
        else. Then I asked myself this question, “if there was one thing in this
        world and this life that i wanted to be better at than a billion people,
        what would it be”, I had a short think. I didn’t believe in saying
        “being the best coder” or “money making” or “chess”. I said to myself I
        wanted to be the happiest man ever, I want to be happier than billions.
        That answer, though having some truth didn’t sit right in my head. So, I
        told chatgpt my question and what led to the question and my answer and
        how I felt about the answer. Chatgpt said a lot that made me reflect, it
        said things like what does it really mean to me to be the happiest man.
        At the end it said that happiness wasn’t really what i was chasing, but
        wisdom. I was like ah yes! this feels right. Wisdom. I indeed want
        people to look at me as the wisest in the room. For people to seek my
        opinion and my knowledge about certain matters. To be calm when everyone
        else panics and to act from principles and not impulses. To be respected
        and listened to. To be a master of myself. Now I want to try to grow and
        become a man with great knowledge and wisdom. It will take time, time
        sitting in silence, observing my thoughts, learning more about the
        person I am, read the about the timeless events and information.
        Avoiding stimulation from social media and the likes. That’s it, time to
        sleep. I’ll wake up tomorrow and be mindful of God. Then spend my day
        learning, enduring and staying mindful always. InshaAllah.
