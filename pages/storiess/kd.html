    On Eid day I randomly had this urge to travel to Kaduna and so I travelled the
next day. I don’t understand how it was that my parents easily agreed
considering that I told them I wanted to leave the next day. But my parents are
like that and I’m glad.<br> I called my uncle to let him know that I was coming to
his house there in Kaduna, he said he’d love for me to come but it wasn’t really
a good time. He continued saying he had just divorced his wife. I told him I was
aware of all that and he said well then I was welcome. After that conversation I
considered cancelling because I had thoughts that I wasn’t really welcome, and
though I could’ve also just crashed at my other cousins house, the main reason I
wanted to go there was because of him. So I pushed those negative thoughts away,
packed my clothes for two days and booked my ticket for tomorrow’s train.<br> Well,
I tried to book the tickets but I couldn’t. To book a train ticket I’m required
to use my NIN and the phone number that was linked to my NIN. But I lost the
phone number linked to my NIN a long time ago. I tried changing the phone number
on the NIN website, I also couldn’t do that because my NIN was still classified
as minor’s NIN. I’m not sure why it doesn’t automatically upgrade when I turned
18. So, to upgrade I’d have to go to the NIN office. Even now that I have the
time to do that I’m too lazy, and I’m shy as well. Anyway, all that wasn’t going
to stop me from fulfilling my random desire to travel to Kaduna. I informed my
dad and he said I should go to the train station early and buy a ticket there. I
felt weird being driven by the bolt driver as we were on the way to the train
station, normally I’m the one always driving but for the first time in a while I
became the passenger princess. I arrived at the station and asked where I could
buy a ticket. I was directed and when I gave my information to buy the ticket I
had the same problem as I did when I first tried to book online. They advised me
to buy a business minor ticket. First of all it was business class which was
about 3000 naira more than the normal ticket, and second it’s a minor’s ticket,
meaning I had to be accompanied by an adult. It made no sense why buying a minor
ticket was a solution to my issue or why it had to be business class instead of
the normal minor ticket. But I just wanted to have my ticket and leave the place
so I didn’t ask any questions. I bought the ticket and waited for the time to
travel.<br> We boarded the train as soon as it arrived. There were very few people
traveling, after all who travels from Abuja to Kaduna a day after Eid? At some
point I thought about how I was going to get a ticket back to Abuja. It was a
genuine concern, considering that I only planned to spend two days, and that was
a week where everyone who travelled to Kaduna earlier would be rushing to come
back. I checked the train website and to my surprise, most of the tickets for
the next few days had been sold out. I then refrained from thinking about that
for the rest of the journey. I focused on my train ride. I sat in silence the
whole trip, thinking about who knows what. 3 plus hours of sitting and doing
nothing. There was empty seats next to me, and one woman across the table, so I
was quite comfortable. It was my first time travelling by myself. Though, it
didn’t feel strange. It felt… normal. Maybe cause I’ve always preferred to do
things by myself.<br> We arrived safely at Kaduna, my uncle hadn’t arrived at the
station yet so I went to pray. Oh how happy I am when I get to pray 2 raka’ats
instead of 4. After praying I looked for my shoes where I left them but they
weren’t there. My first thought was that my first experience in Kaduna was
having my shoes stolen. I looked around and saw a shoe shiner shining the shoes.
I was relieved. I don’t remember why but I didn’t get a chance to thank him or
give him money. I left to find my uncle and we hugged, entered his car and took
off to his house.<br> The next day was a really fun day. It started with my uncle
worrying that I was going to be too bored at his house. I told him I like to
embrace boredom, or maybe that’s what I say because I want people to think I’m
wise or something. Anyway, after praying Dhuhr, I walked around the area. I had
seen on google maps there was a chicken republic near by. I walked to the place
but there was no chicken republic, just an abandoned building. I felt betrayed
by the same trust worthy google maps who had always led me to places I’d never
been in Abuja. I walked a few more meters there and behold, there was a chicken
republic. I bought and enjoyed their sandwich. It was a hundred naira cheaper
than the ones in Abuja but the quality was slightly not as good as Abuja. After
that I found a park on google maps that was also near by. I hopped on a bike to
get their. The place looked nothing like the pictures I saw on the map. I
quickly left before the craziness of the kids swimming in the nasty pool would
rub off on me. I went back home after my mini exploration. My uncle said he was
going to take us bowling at some new place. We went together with Yasir. I think
Yasir is my mom’s cousin, though he looks about my age. At the bowling place I
had to briefly learn the rules and techniques from chatgpt. I had never bowled
in my life so I didn’t want to look stupid in the presence of the fine girls at
the fancy bowling place. I learned and adapted quickly and got 2nd place just
few points behind my uncle. After having some drinks and leaving the place, my
uncle took me to my other cousins house from my father’s side where I was meant
to spend my last night. That same the day, in the evening I went out with my
cousins to a fancy restaurant owned by my father’s friends wife. They gave us
free tea and we chilled there for a while before heading to another food place
to buy burgers and shawarma. On our way back home, we stopped by at a house and
they gave us meat and stuff. Then, as we left the house, the car stopped on the
road. We had to push the car off the road and figure out the problem. It was the
battery. We walked back to the other house to borrow their battery and start our
car. We started the car and went back home. Many other things happened that day,
good and bad, it was a weird day.<br> It was the day for me to leave, but I didn’t
have a ticket and all tickets for the day were sold out. I discussed with my dad
and he asked his friend about it who then asked his friend at the station if I
could get a ticket. He said yes, I should meet with him early to get someone
else’s ticket. So, when it was time I booked a bolt ride to the train station
and found Oga Tanko, who gave me a ticket with a name like “Fatima Dahiru”. “Am
I really gonna get away with this?”, I thought, and I did. The officials and the
boarding place and the ones inside the train only scan if the tickets are valid.
They don’t care if you use someone else’s ticket. It was another 3 hours of
sitting in silence but this time less comfortable and more noisy.
