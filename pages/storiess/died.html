        It’s not an exaggeration that I almost died 4 times. It was 4 different
        car accidents I’ve been part of over the years. The first two were not
        too serious, but the last two made me not want to be in a car ever
        again. <br />

        The first ever car accident I experienced was between 2013 and 2015. I
        can’t recall the exact time but I remember vividly how it happened. We
        were on our way to Sokoto from Abuja for the holidays. My uncle was
        driving us in his Peugeot 406. I don’t remember if my dad was there in
        the passenger sit or if he wasn’t with us at all. But my mother and two
        sisters were in the car. We had driven a long amount of hours and just
        entered into the state of Sokoto but not yet reached any suburbs or
        village. Then all of sudden there was a goat and her kid crossing the
        road. My uncle while speeding committed to slowing down for the goats to
        pass by, when he noticed the goats stopped in the middle of the road he
        hit the brakes to stop the car. Meanwhile a car behind us coming with
        speed rear-ended us. My uncle lost control of the steering and the car
        skidded off the road. We spun 360 degrees about 3 times before the car
        came to a complete stop. It was scary how the car kept spinning and I
        was afraid we might hit a big rock or a tree as I braced myself
        expecting a big impact. Luckily it was only sand on the field off the
        road, and luckily we were not too far from Sokoto. My mom still looked
        frightened even minutes after the car became immobile. We called the
        house and waited almost an hour until we were picked up and taken home
        safe.<br />

        The second accident was minor and didn’t involve any other cars. We had
        entered into the city of Abuja after a 7 hour drive from Katsina. This
        time, I was with a totally different set of people, namely my grand
        father who was the driver, my grandmother, my two young uncles with my
        aunty and I were at the back seats. We reached a roundabout in Asokoro,
        but my grand father did not see the roundabout. I wasn’t looking at the
        road but before I knew it we were on top of the roundabout. There was a
        big impact because of the curb. Luckily, it wasn’t one of those
        roundabouts with huge curbs but instead one low enough that we passed
        over it. The impact triggered my asthma, and my inhaler was in my box
        inside the boot. My aunt though had her inhaler in her purse and she
        immediately handed it to me to use. Till today I wonder how my
        grandfather didn’t see the roundabout when cars in front of him clearly
        slowed down and drove round. But oh well.<br />

        The third accident involved 100s of people and many lives were lost that
        day. It was a big trailer whose brakes were at fault and couldn’t stop
        the car. The trailer sped past cars on the highway hitting any car on
        its way. It then took the exit onto the bridge at Karu. On climbing the
        bridge it hit so many cars into gutters and people also got hit and many
        injured and died. It was a chaotic scene and I tell mostly from what I
        heard about the accident. What I remember was my mom, uncle, sisters and
        I were parked by the side of the road buying plantain chips. Then my mom
        screamed out loud “Sadiq Kawce”, my uncle who quickly understand the
        situation put the car on drive and moved forward but not quick enough to
        avoid collision with the trailer. The trailer shoved us slightly and our
        car slanted into the gutter. I was the only one who sustained some
        injuries in the car because I was playing around in the boot of the
        Sienna while everything was happening. Though before the trailer hit us
        I tried to quickly hop in the back seats but the back glass of the car
        shattered on my feet and I was bleeding. I try to refrain from saying
        things like “if I hadn’t jumped into the back seat in time” or similar
        statements because I think Allah had already decreed what was meant to
        happen. My uncle describing the accident some days later said that if we
        hadn’t moved forward that tiny bit the trailer would’ve crushed our car
        entirely. We were the last car the trailer hit before it finally flipped
        to its side and stopped. The driver came out and ran as fast as he could
        but he was very quickly caught. I feel for him because on the one hand
        you can claim it wasn’t your fault but on the other if feels like you
        just single handedly killed dozens of innocent people.<br />

        The fourth and most deadly accident I’ve experienced in my 20 years of
        living was in 2019. My dad, two sisters and I travelled to Sokoto. My
        sister and I, Sa’ada, told our dad that we were tired of the place after
        2 weeks of being there. He was due to stay there for about 4 more days
        but he said we could go along with our cousins to Kaduna, then from
        there to Abuja. So Sa’ada and I tagged along with our uncle, aunty and 4
        cousins. While my other sister, Khadija, was to follow my dad back by
        plane. Thinking about it now I’m not sure how 5 of us fit into the back
        seats of my uncles peugeot. The day before we left, our other cousins
        back in Sokoto really didn’t want us to leave so early and jokingly said
        prayers about postponing the trip. But we set out to leave for Kaduna
        the next day, until we collided with a trailer. I was already half
        asleep when it happened, but I could remember hearing my cousins scream
        just before the impact. I didn’t hear from my cousins what happened
        exactly moments before the collision, but from the scenes after I gained
        consciousness and pictures of our destroyed car it was clear that the
        front of the speeding trailer collided with the front of our car.
        Somehow I heard the screams before the accident but I didn’t feel the
        impact. All I saw was black, then I opened my eyes and saw myself being
        pulled out of the car, and then it was black again. Just like in movies
        when an explosion happens and the character keeps blacking out until
        they fully regain consciousness. That was exactly what happened to me.
        Finally when I regained consciousness I felt myself leaning on the legs
        of a random guy. I looked around, trying to make sense of what had just
        happened. Then I thought “Oh, we had an accident”. I was calm about it
        for a few minutes, till the pain of my dislocated shoulder and broken
        arm started kicking in. There were dozens of people who came to help us.
        Eventually an ambulance arrived and we were transported to the nearest
        hospital, still within Sokoto but far from inside town. My sister only
        had one minor injury. My cousin, the oldest male in their family, also
        had a minor injury. His brother had tiny pieces of glass shattered
        around his face. Their youngest sister of 4 years old who was in the
        front seat with her mom miraculously came out without a scratch. Their
        mom had several injuries, while their dad was severely injured to the
        point that he didn’t know where he was 3 hours after the accident. I
        can’t remember if the eldest sister who was at the back with us got
        injured or not. We were all attended to at the hospital. They injected
        some fluids in me, I assume pain killers or drugs to make me fall
        asleep. I heard one of them say in Hausa something like “his blood is
        too hot”. I knew I was cooked. They made me sit straight and held me as
        the doctor put my shoulder back in place. I was really painful, but I
        still dozed off after a couple minutes. I woke up some 2 hours later and
        saw my dad staring at me. I don’t know what he was thinking but if it
        was me I’d probably be thinking to myself “I’m never letting my kids
        influence me again”. My mom was in Abuja when it happened. When she
        described what she felt, she said my dad called her briefly and said we
        were involved in an accident with a trailer and were on hospital beds.
        He didn’t say anything else, so she was worried about us and cried for
        minutes, thinking she was about to lose us. It was quite silly of my dad
        not to further explain that we were okay. Eventually we were admitted
        out of the hospital and went back home in Sokoto. I joked with my
        cousins about their prayers being answered. 3 days later we flew back to
        Abuja with my dad. One funny thing is during all this time I didn’t know
        my arm was broken till 2 days after being in Abuja. It was the part of
        my arm close to my wrist, I constantly felt pain but I thought it’d just
        go away. The broken bone also made my arm look swollen and I just
        thought it was a boil. It wasn’t until I tried to force myself to stand
        up from the floor with my hands that I could see the arm bending. That’s
        when I told my mom then my dad called some traditional doctor guy, I
        don’t even know what they call them. He rubbed some brown mud-looking
        stuff on my arm and prayed on it. Then placed a piece of long thin wood
        and wrapped my arm with bandage. My broken arm healed after 3 or so
        weeks.
