        5:53pm on a random Wednesday<br />

        I don’t really know what to say, I’ve not journaled since 12 days since
        my last entry and a lot of times there’s things i wanna write down but
        i’m lazy or i don’t feel like journaling or i don’t have time. But now
        that i have time, all those things i wanted to write down and not in my
        head write now. So, now I’m just going to write the things i can
        currently think of or things that are currently happening.<br />

        I want to try to become more of a monk like the budha. I like the idea
        of being at peace or being happy at all times whether i’m in a terrible
        or uncomfortable position or i’m having the time of my life. I also want
        to get closer to God. I’m not sure if those two things can like align or
        something. Buddhism is a whole different religion but it’s not like i
        want to practice that religion. I just want to be more at peace with
        myself and not fighting myself every time cause i’m not being the person
        i want to be even though i keep trying so hard and failing so hard.
        Actually i realised i always say that i take a step towards goodness and
        then i fall 3 stories but what actually happens is i try to jump to the
        3rd story and then fall back down. So now i know i actually have to just
        take it one step at a time. How do i go about that then, i don’t really
        know what steps to do, but i guess if i just sit and think i’ll come up
        with useful things to do with my life and become better slowly but
        surely.<br />

        I just zoned out for like 2 minutes, i’m just gonna call it a journal
        now…
