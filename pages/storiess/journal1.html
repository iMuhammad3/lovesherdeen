        Assalamu Alaikum ya Muhammad ibn Auwalu<br> 
        Idk maybe I’m excited today even
        though I’m currently tired and sleepy. 10:43pm btw. I’ve been motivated
        by Aisha Gulani to write a poem so that’s what I’m gonna do now. The
        poem is going to be about how I’ve been feeling about life for the past
        few days. First I’m going to do some reading then scroll on my second ig
        account for more inspo and dump all the words and ideas into this
        entry.<br />

        This will be a bit unorganized to my future reading but whatever here it
        goes.<br />

        a hapless journey’s end, blameworthy, mindful, comprehend, perhaps it is
        soon, something about time, fear,mercy, add some analogies and parables,
        dawn till dusk, bones and ashes, delusion, <br />

        okay so 3 or 4 stanzas<br />

        first will be about life, second about hereafter, third about reward and
        punishment or maybe about how we dont have time<br />

        A play and amusement, is the worldly life,<br />

        A test for those who strive for strife,<br />

        Moments of joy and moments of pain,<br />

        and a fear that our efforts may be in vain<br /><br />

        Gardens of joy for those mindful,<br />

        or scorching fire in an endless cycle,<br />

        clear is the choice between the two,<br />

        yet most crave evil, if only they knew<br /><br />

        Perhaps it is far, perhaps it is soon,<br />

        But the inevitable hour will come to pass,<br />

        we leave behind all that we’ve done<br />

        except the deeds that determine who’s won<br /><br />

        now its 29 oct 12am and I’ve finally come around to finish this<br />

        Oh well, I’m not proud of it but hopefully i can come up with some
        better poems.
