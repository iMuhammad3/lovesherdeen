        My online friend is Sophie Olamide Jegede. She has one of the weirdest
        name combinations ever. Who even names their child Jegede? Sophie is
        Nigerian, Irish and Scottish. I’m quite jealous. Her mom is Nigerian,
        her dad is Irish, and she has lived in Scotland for the amount years the
        country requires for you to be citizen. She was Muslim revert then and I
        remember teaching her somethings in Islam but now I don’t think she
        follows any religion. Why do I know so much about Sophie? Because we go
        way back.<br />

        It started during the lockdown in 2020. Everybody and their brother were
        on this app called House Party. An app where you can create a party with
        your friends and just video chat while playing games or doing some other
        activities. You could also join random parties that were set to public.
        The app discontinued in 2022 due to some issues they had with some big
        company I can’t remember, maybe Apple or something. If you haven’t
        guessed already, I met Sophie on the app, through my uncle who is 3
        years older than me. In my head I used to call him a “pedo” for talking
        to random girls that were 5 years younger than him. 17 year old talking
        to 12 year olds? C’mon Uncle Muhammad you’re better than that.<br />

        We’d be on house party with my friends and Sophie and her friends and
        also random people every night. Lockdown was a really cruel but fun
        time. Then eventually Sophie and I were chatting everyday and somehow I
        became besties with a random stranger that lived in a country which is
        also inside a country. The Brits are some really confused lads if I’m
        being honest. I don’t remember what exactly made us besties or what we
        used to talk about everyday but it happened and few years later she came
        to Nigeria.<br />

        In June of 2023, Sophie chatted me up having not spoken for 1 year plus
        cause there wasn’t really anything to talk about anymore. After all
        there was no more lockdown so we had school to go back to and lives to
        live. She texted me like it was just to catch up and I replied. Then 2
        days later she sent a snap with location showing she was in Nigeria.
        First thing that came to my mind was “we have to meet!”, and we did. She
        was in some state in the southern Nigeria, either Ondo, Oyo, Ogun, or
        Osun. I really can’t tell the difference between those states. She was
        in Lagos as well before she finally came to Abuja for 4 days. Funny
        thing is we almost met all 4 days.<br />

        First day of her being in Abuja we decided I’d come and meet her at her
        uncles house where she was staying, which was just few minutes from my
        own house. The reason I didn’t end up going was because I already made
        plans to play football with my friends who actually also know her. I
        didn’t want to abandon my friends for Sophie mostly because it didn’t
        feel right and besides we had 3 more days to meet. <br />

        On the second day she said she was following her mom to Jabi Lake Mall
        to some dentist or eye clinic, I can’t remember. I told her I’d come and
        we could buy fan ice from Shoprite. She used to talk about how she liked
        fan ice back in 2020. So I drove to Jabi Lake Mall, 3 minute walk from
        my house by the way. I entered the building and suddenly I was scared to
        see her. I didn’t know if she was taller than me, I didn’t know what i
        was going to say even though at that point we’d spoken for thousands of
        hours online over 2 years. I wanted to run away, but I convinced myself
        not to, after all I was trying to become less of an introvert then. She
        texted that she was at the entrance of Shoprite and there I went and saw
        her together with her Mom’s boyfriend. I greeted him and he was very
        friendly and told us to have a nice day. And there was Sophie, shorter
        than me but looked the same as she did in pictures and snaps. Thank God
        I didn’t get catfished. Before we met I texted her not to attempt to hug
        me, so I didn’t worry about whether she was going to hug me or not. The
        first thing she told me was that she needed to pee, so i escorted her to
        the restroom and held her bag before she was done. We entered Shoprite
        and picked up some fan ice. I was ready to pay the bills until she
        picked some Oreo thing in the freezer for 8k?! I let her take lead and
        she paid for everything. While we were in Shoprite, two guys approached
        us and asked if we were dating, we didn’t answer but we stared at them
        with a face that said, the f***? Then one of them asked Sophie for her
        number. She gave him a wrong number and we left the place laughing. We
        passed by KFC and she said let’s eat. I’m like okay rich girl let’s eat.
        We ordered some food, chatted as we waited, sent snaps to our mutual
        friends and ate. Few minutes later her mom came to us and I greeted and
        that was the end of our meeting and I’d never see her again… sike!<br />

        We met the next day. Yeah we decided we wanted more so she somehow found
        Blu Cabana on google maps and said let’s go there. I had never gone to
        Blu Cabana but I knew it was one of them fancy rich people restaurants.
        We were set to meet at 4pm. Her uncle drove her and they arrived at
        3:58pm waiting for me. I was still at home praying Asr. I was done
        praying and quickly left and arrived at 4:08pm. I greeted the uncle but
        he didn’t seem too friendly, after he left she told me he said I’m doing
        African time. Like bro i was literally 8 minutes late! African time is 2
        hours after event time. But anyways we entered and she led the way,
        asking about the place and getting us a table, as if it wasn’t my
        country she came to. It might be worth noting that this outing I
        actually ditched my friends who asked me to go play football with them.
        Anyways we checked out their menu and not to my surprise she wanted to
        get everything on the menu. I, on the other had couldn’t tell what was
        what cause all I saw was some weird fancy food names that I didn’t have
        a clue what they were. So I ordered fruits and pizza. I also couldn’t
        tell what drinks had alcohol in them or not, I was even thinking of
        buying water. To be honest I can’t remember what type of drink I bought.
        We talked about a bunch of things that day. I can’t remember anything
        else. We were done and she took a cute video of us while we waited for
        her uncle. That was it… or was it?<br />

        On her final day we wanted to meet again at her uncle’s house. She said
        after she was done at the salon then I could come. She spent way more
        time there than we expected so we forgot about it. And that was it, she
        was done with her summer vacay in Nigeria and had flown back to her
        country. Maybe one I’ll go to Scotland and meet her to buy her KFC.
